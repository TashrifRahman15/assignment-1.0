                    <p>You are great at what you do. You have a clear roadmap of where you want your career to take you.
                        However, even when you
                        have every step, milestone, and promotion mapped out, the reality is that advancing doesnot
                        happen overnight, and its
                        common for work energy levels to drop â€” particularly at the end of the year. Suddenly things
                        that you took in your
                        stride can feel like a slog and you can get bogged down and demotivated. For example, a
                        professional development course
                        you were excited about a month ago starts to feel like a drain on your energy, or a work project
                        you felt confident
                        about suddenly appears to be overwhelming.</p> <br>
